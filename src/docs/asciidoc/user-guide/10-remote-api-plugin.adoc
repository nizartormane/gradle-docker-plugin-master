== Remote API Plugin

The plugin `com.bmuschko.docker-remote-api` allows for interacting with Docker via its remote API.
If no additional configuration has been provided by the build script, the plugin will try to resolve and use the credentials for registry authentication available from previous `login` operations (usually in `$HOME/.docker/config.json`). You can model any workflow imaginable by creating enhanced task of the custom task provided by the plugin.
